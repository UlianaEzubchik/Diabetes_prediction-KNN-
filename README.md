## Overview

The dataset used in this project (`diabetes.csv`) contains diagnostic measurements for a sample of individuals, including features such as glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, and others. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of diabetes.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Missing values in certain columns are replaced with the mean value of the column.
- **Feature Scaling:** Standard scaling is applied to normalize the features.
- **Model Training:** A KNN classifier is trained using the training data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics such as confusion matrix, F1 score, and accuracy score are calculated on the test data.

## Dependencies

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
